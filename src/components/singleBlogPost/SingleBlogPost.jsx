            REMODELING PROJECTS THAT WILL BOOST YOUR HOME’S
          </h1>
          <p className="singleBlogDesc">
            There are two ways to think about remodeling projects that will
            boost your home’s value; you can get one or two major remodels done
            or opt for a bunch of small fixes. Depending on your budget and your
            timetable, one approach may be better for you than the other. For
            instance, if you have an unfinished basement, maybe your dream when
            you first moved into your home was to refinish it. It never
            happened. But now that you are thinking about selling your home, you
            feel that a prospective buyer would really appreciate a full
            finished basement. Is that the remodeling project that you should do
            before selling? On the other hand, you want to spend as little as
            possible to squeeze as much value out of your home. Maybe you would
            prefer to just spruce up the kitchen cabinets or repaint the house.
            Whichever camp you fall into here are some remodeling project ideas
            that usually add at least a few thousand dollars to the value of
            your home. Interior Improvements Depending on where you live, some
            remodeling projects bring in more dollars on resale than others.
            Here are some of the interior remodeling projects that can help
            boost your home’s value: Kitchen Upgrades: Potential buyers these
            days want spacious, modern kitchens. Simple upgrades like adding new
            appliances, granite countertops, or new cabinets can pull in the big
            bucks. Some big-ticket improvements that usually add value include:
            Adding an island Adding a breakfast nook Adding new ceramic flooring
            Adding accent lighting Removing Walls: The style right now is open
            concept kitchens and living rooms. If you have an older home, you
            could knock down a wall or two to really open up more interior
            space. If they’re load-bearing walls, removing them will usually
            push the price tag up. But non-load-bearing walls are easy to take
            out to add a pass-through window or a bigger entryway. Use a
            professional contractor to make sure the job is done right. Room
            Additions: Believe it or not, adding a new room to your home is not
            as expensive as you might think and can greatly increase your home’s
            value. Think about converting your attic into a spare room or
            building a new room addition onto your house. The added space
            increases the overall square footage of your property and will push
            your asking price up. Exterior Improvements They are often
            overlooked when making improvements to your home, but there are a
            number of exterior projects that can boost your home’s value. Here
            are just a few ideas for exterior improvements: Outdoor Living
            Space: Especially in warm weather climates, buyers want a home with
            comfortable outdoor living spaces. That could mean adding in a slate
            patio or a wooden deck. Make your outdoor living space an oasis by
            adding in path lights, pathways, plants, shrubs, and trees. Siding
            Upgrades: If you are making simple upgrades on the cheap just to
            spiff up your home exterior, a good paint job will do. To really
            boost your home’s value try adding new siding. If you replace
            portions of your siding with stone veneers, it will greatly improve
            curb appeal and your home’s value. Driveways/Garages: If you haven’t
            paved your driveway in a while, new paving is an excellent exterior
            improvement that makes a good impression as soon as buyers pull up
            to your home. Your garage doors and exterior also make a good or bad
            impression. Even if you do not make any changes to your garage, you
            should clean it out and organize its contents for resale. Replace
            broken windows and locks and give it a good paint job. A qualified
            agent with years of experience in the real estate market can help
            you determine the best improvements to make based on your particular
            market. When you’re ready to learn more, connect with us today.
